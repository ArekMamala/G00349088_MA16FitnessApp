                1.When down on the ground, set your hands at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. ...
                2.Your feet should be set up in a way that feels right and comfortable to you. ...
                3.Think of your body as one giant straight line â€“ from the top of your head down through your heels.

                  Pull-ups. Hang in the hollow position with hands slightly wider than your
                  shoulders, thumb-less grip and pull the full range of motion until the 
                  chin is over the bar. When you are close to getting over the bar, 
                  shoot your elbows down and back to increase the height that you will get over the bar.

                    Lie on your back on an exercise mat. Place your hands behind your head, lightly touching the back of your skull. Bend your knees and plant your feet about hip-distance apart.
                    Exhale and engage your abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Keep this engagement as you roll up as high as possible.
                    Inhale as you slowly roll back to the starting position to complete one sit-up, or crunch if you don't come all the way up.

                  <p>
                      Keep your back straight, with your neutral spine, and your chest and 
                      shoulders up. Keep looking straight ahead at that spot on the wall. 
                      As you squat down, focus on keeping your knees in line with your feet. 
                      Many new lifters need to focus on pushing their knees out so they track with their feet.
